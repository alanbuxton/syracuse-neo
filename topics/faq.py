    "Who are you and what is this?": "I'm <a href=\"https://alanbuxton.wordpress.com/\">Alan Buxton</a> and this is my open-ish data project.",

    "What sort of open-ish data?": "Syracuse takes raw data from various text documents (currently news articles, but it could be any text document) and uses machine learning to structure the relevant content into linkages and timelines. You can see the latest sources on the <a href='//activity_stats'>Stats page</a>. Currently it's only English-language sources.",

    "Why would I use it?": "Three main purposes: [a] getting alerts about company events, [b] looking at family trees (e.g. if I'm doing business with Company A, and they are owned by Company B then what other companies are also owned by Company B) and [c] researching company activities in a region. In this context a 'company event' is something like a new senior hire, or launching in a region, or taking on investment. These use cases could be useful in Know Your Customer / Know Your Supplier processes.",

    "How can you call this open when you need to log in?": "Initially I wanted to keep everything as open as possible. OpenCorporates is a big influence on me. But it turned out that the vast majority of usage is bots and scrapers. To work around this there is an anonymous user that you can log in with. The user is <b>anon</b> and the password is shown on the login page. It's still in the spirit of open-ish data. If it turns out that there is a free/cheap service that supports open data projects which filters out bots and scrapers from using your site then, of course, I'd look at using that. But for now let's see how well this shared anon login process works.",

    "Why Syracuse?": "I called my first natural language processing application <a href=\"https://alanbuxton.wordpress.com/2021/09/21/transformers-for-use-oriented-entity-extraction/\">Napoli</a> because it includes all the consonants in NLP (the abbreviation for natural language processing). Since then I've given my other projects similarly-themed names related to Ancient Greek Mediterranean coastal towns and cities.",

    "How does this offering differ from &lt;any other business news aggregator&gt;?": "The key difference is that this is highly automated with machine learning together with some rules and heuristics. Historically, the tech for doing this sort of thing suffered from what we used to call the <a href=\"https://alanbuxton.wordpress.com/2023/01/02/revisiting-entity-extraction/\">Bloomberg problem</a>. Briefly, there is plenty of tech available that will tell you what company names a document contains, but figuring out what these companies are doing with each other is a lot harder to do automatically. A lot of articles mention Bloomberg, but only a small proportion of them are about Bloomberg the company. The providers out there who are doing this sort of thing rely heavily on human analysts to work around the Bloomberg problem. Doing this via machine, which 1145 does, makes it viable to offer it for free as open data.",

    "How does this offering differ from AI sites like Perplexity?": "Syracuse is tuned for company searches. The well-known AI companies are much more general-purpose. Here's some code you can use to compare: <a href=\"https://github.com/alanbuxton/news-comparison\">https://github.com/alanbuxton/news-comparison</a>.",

    "What's 1145?": "This was a domain I bought a long time ago for a company idea that never got off the ground. A lot of programmers collect domain names for side projects and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/hp5q56/here_i_go_again/\">we rarely, if ever, part with them</a>. I like the idea of technology making your life easier so that you get your day's work done by lunchtime. So 1145.am is the domain being used to host this application and the umbrella term for all the associated components that feed into the Syracuse application which you're browsing right now.",

    "There are other components to this?": "Yep: Heraklion scrapes data, Alexandria classifies it, Massalia is used to label example texts for machine learning and Corinth takes the Massalia data and adds further synthetic data for machine learning training. Neapolis uses machine learning to extract relevant information from the documents and structures them into an RDF format for Syracuse to ingest and display.",

    "Is there any generative AI in here?": "One part of the 1145 system (Neapolis) uses <a href=\"https://alanbuxton.wordpress.com/2022/11/25/entity-extraction-powered-by-flan/\">an out-of-the-box FlanT5 model</a> to help extract some meaning from text, but the bulk of the machine learning is a fine-tuned RoBERTa model used for classification and then one <a href=\"https://alanbuxton.wordpress.com/2021/10/06/is-it-worth-training-an-nlp-transformer-from-scratch/\">fine-tuned RoBERTa model per type of activity</a> to do the named entity extraction. Very little GenAI, but plenty of large language models and Machine Learning.",

    "Does it suffer from hallucinations?": "Not really, because any generative element is run within very tight guardrails. But there could be other errors creeping in that aren't hallucinations, which is why there's a feedback form that you are free to use if you spot anything that looks wrong.",

    "What sort of accuracy does it have?": "No ML system is going to be 100% correct all the time. Accuracy is usually measured by looking at False Positives and False Negatives. A False Positive is when the system says that something happened when it didn't happen. A False Negative is missing something that we would have liked the system to spot. 1145 leans a bit more towards minimising false positives. This does increase the risk of false negatives. But 1145 is looking at multiple data sources so even if it misses a topic from one source, we should expect to be find it in another one. It seems a reasonable position to take in the accuracy balancing act, but more than happy to hear feedback from anyone using this.",

    "How comprehensive is it?": "Hard to say, but it will only get more comprehensive as more data sources get added to it. It is a fully automated system and so can scale without too much effort",
    
    "What about the <a href=\"https://copyrightblog.kluweriplaw.com/2024/02/29/is-generative-ai-fair-use-of-copyright-works-nyt-v-openai/\">New York Times's law-suit against OpenAI</a> - if OpenAI's work turns out to be illegal then doesn't that risk destroying this project?": "I'm not a lawyer but my common-sense view is that 1145 is more similar to a search engine than to a generative AI service. 1145 helps you find relevant data related to a company or region that you're interested in with full provenance back to the original data source. It's not creating things that may or may not breach someone's intellectual property rights. All the scraped data in it is scraped responsibly (e.g. respecting robots.txt and not using any special tools to work around captchas).",

    "What's the license?": "I am licensing the data that you access via the website via the <a href=\"https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/\">Open Database License</a>. This is the same share-alike license that <a href=\"https://opencorporates.com/\">OpenCorporates</a> uses. If you're familiar with OpenCorporates then the model is the same here.",
     
    "What about if the share-alike license isn't for me?": "Drop me a line and we can discuss. I'm more than happy to charge people for API access or bulk data in order to fund the future development of this project. Very similar to the OpenCorporates approach which I admire greatly.",

    "I love this, can I access it via API?": "Of course. <a href=\"https://syracuse.1145.am/api/schema/swagger-ui\">Schema docs are here</a>. You will need to register for an API key using <pre>register-and-get-key</pre>. If you like it and want more access, <a href=\"mailto:info-syracuse@1145.am\">send me an email</a>.",

    "This fails <a href=\"https://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/\">condition 1.2 of the Open Definition</a> so how can you represent it as open data?": "Bored. Next. ..... In all seriousness, this is why I am calling it open-ish data. The important point is that anyone can browse this data for free and I'm more than happy to give the underlying data to people working in the public benefit either via API or via a data dump. Please <a href=\"mailto:info-syracuse@1145.am\">send a mail</a> if you'd like to discuss.",

    "Is the code open source?": "The <a href=\"https://github.com/alanbuxton/syracuse-neo\">Syracuse codebase</a> is released with an MIT license. When I was learning these technologies there weren't many resources available to help with <a href=\"https://www.django-rest-framework.org/\">Django Rest Framework, <a href=\"https://neo4j.com/\">Neo4j</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework\">RDF</a>, so I'm open sourcing the codebase in the hope that it can help others learn from my learnings. And also that others out there can point out problems in my code that I can learn from and improve.",

    "Is it all open source?": "Nope. Just the Syracuse piece is open source. The other parts of the 1145 ecosystem that are running behind the scenes are top secret proprietary intellectual property :)",

    "What about Cookies?": "This site does some high level tracking with Google Analytics so I can get a sense of who is accessing the site and from where. It uses its own cookies for [a] authenticating your login and [b] internal security features (so-called 'csrf tokens'). That's it. No advertising partners.",

    "Do you have a Privacy Policy?": "The privacy policy is really simple. This site is run by me (see above). I have no way of knowing anything about specific anonymous people browsing the site. If you login then I will have access to whatever login data you provide plus which companies you are tracking without seeking your prior consent. I cannot cross-reference this data with any Google Analytics usage patterns. Nor will I provide anything to do with your login data to anyone else for any kind of personal gain without your consent. If there are legal reasons that mean I have to hand over this data then I won't have much choice. Where I am legally permitted to do so, I will do my best to let you know if this happens.",

    "How will you seek my consent or let me know?": "If you've given your email address so you can get tracked organization updates then I will use this to notify you of anything that needs your consent. If you have not given your email address then I won't be able to contact you directly, so I'll flag important notices on this website to give you plenty of time to let me know of any concerns, but if I hear nothing then I will need to interpret that as you giving me consent. I hope this is all common sense and not contentious at all, but if I'm missing something major then please don't use the site, or by all means find another channel to reach out to me to help me understand the issue.",

    "How frequently-asked are these questions?": "Not at all, to be honest. This page is me writing down an imaginary conversation between me and someone who I'm trying to explain the website to.",

    "Website looks a bit rubbish, mate.": "Yep, I'm not going to disagree on that front. Front-end web design really is not my bag - just have a look at the quality of the favicon. But, to be honest, this 1995-era aesthetic seems to go pretty well with a site that's all about the data so I'm not too worried.",

    "And it's slow.": "You're browsing a version of this site that is running on one small cloud machine for demo/proof-of-concept purposes more than anything else. Please do a bit forgiving if it's not blazing fast. Thanks.",
