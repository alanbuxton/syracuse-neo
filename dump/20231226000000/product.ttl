Providing a remedy for poorly performing GPS - based geofencing solutions that require people to carry their phones with them, the new microservice intelligently detects and understands occupancy conditions of a home based on motion patterns derived from activity sensors. Complex occupancy status decisions are made quickly and accurately from sensor data through a combination of patent pending machine learning algorithms, designed to determine the four essential occupancy states of home, away, vacation and sleep along with the transitions between those states. Highly complex algorithms extract several dozen dimensions of occupancy factors in the home from thousands of data points, including the day, time, door activity, motion activity, energy and water use, supporting geofencing data and more. The Home Occupancy Status Microservice is also capable of knowing when people are asleep to deliver advanced automation, senior care and wellness solutions from understanding a person's natural sleep patterns." ;

The enhanced platform allows managers to monitor and review team behavior and spend, while extracting themselves from mundane approval workflows. Using the combination of AppZen's Insights and existing real-time Expense Audit product, managers no longer need to approve - or even look at - employee expense reports while the company remains compliant with internal and SOX controls. AppZen audits and approves each report in real time, not only saving time for managers but improving the overall employee experience by giving companies the ability to reimburse employees same-day - without compromising controls, accuracy, or peace of mind. \" This is an exciting update for us as it proves how AI can truly disrupt an age-old control and reimbursement process in finance, while massively improving compliance and employee satisfaction ,\" said Anant Kale, Co-founder & CEO of AppZen." ;

Results of the study were presented today at the 2018 American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) Annual Scientific Sessions. Literature shows that the average variability of cardiologist readers using the Simpson's biplane method in estimating EF is 9.2 %. The observed variability of EchoMD AutoEF was superior at 8.29 % (p = 0.002) . The study also demonstrated that EchoMD AutoEF is an accurate and fully automated method of calculating EF from complete echocardiographic patient studies without user intervention.",
