    ns1:documentExtract "FACEBOOK turns 10 years old this week, and much of the conversation around its decadal anniversary has centred on whether its extraordinary rise will continue, or if the social networking behemoth is already on the wane. The most oft-cited argument of the Facebook naysayers is that it is becoming passé among teenagers, who some say are increasingly turning to upstart competitors Snapchat and WhatsApp. However, the company recently posted annual revenues up 55 per cent to £4.8bn, a large portion of which came from its increasingly profitable use of mobile advertising. In order to maintain and accelerate this pace of growth, Facebook would do well to focus on new emerging markets, rather than fickle Western teenagers. This brings us to Brazil, which has embraced social media and is now Facebook's second biggest market after the US." ;

Critics claim that the fracking technique causes earth tremors. Local communities could receive up to £400,000 per site, if four wells are fracked. The government is hoping that a US-style shale gas boom will improve Britain's energy security, bring down reliance on exports and boost the economy, although business secretary Vince Cable warned earlier this week that shale gas would only play a small role in UK energy policy this decade." ;
